🧥 AI Clothing Evaluator

An AI-powered fashion assistant that scrapes premium men’s clothing listings from Poshmark and uses GPT-4o Vision in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to identify stylish, well-priced wardrobe pieces for modern professionals.

This tool combines automated data extraction (Selenium) with multimodal LLM evaluation, allowing it to reason over both image and metadata (brand, price) to assess visual appeal, quality, and deal potential. Ideal for fashion tech, personal styling automation, or smart e-commerce assistants.
